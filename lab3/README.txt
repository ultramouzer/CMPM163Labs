Lab 3

Lower left: purple cube using toon material. copied from lab2.
Upper left: purple and green interpolatiing cube. used code similar
to the example code in the lab document for an interpolated cube.
For some reason it also spawns a 2nd static cube, I don't know why it's
there and I don't know how to remove it.
Middle: green cube using phong material.
Lower right: blue and white-ish cube from the lab document example code.
Upper right: leftovers from lab 2 that I was too lazy to remove.
