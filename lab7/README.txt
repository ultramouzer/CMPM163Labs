I made the trees by using the unity tutorial mesh manipulation on a circle.
I made the mountain and beach the same way but on a plane. I made the
water using the code from the video tutorial. I colored in Unity-chan
by making a new custom shader graph for all the materials on her model.
I imported a free skybox from the asset store.

Which part did they do?

part 1

Which part of a tutorial did your partner find most challenging?

I found the most challenging part of the tutorial the fact that I didn't really know why I was doing anything with shader graph which made me have to go over it all myself and look a lot up for making the vertex displacement look like mountains.

Which part of a tutorial did your partner find most interesting?

I also found messing with the shader graph the most interesting because I enjoy working with such a visual node based format

We worked on our own
