Inspiration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19XtsS6WNgXj81MdwFZPVsrGpdNayNzlT/view?usp=sharing

My inspiration was an Animal Crossing town, so my design was affected by removing most large
buildings, and replacing them with more trees, water, and benches. I also changed the height
some objects were placed so that the water appeared lower than the land.

I was not able to get in contact with my partner.
